<!--PSEUDOCODE: *pick a theme*
1.I will set the HTML part of the screen, the text "id" that will be on the screen. 
2.Establish the variables, for the letters, and for the outputs (wins, losses, current word,  number of guesses remaining, letters already used)
3.Add variables to hold HTML places 
4.Set a function for a random letter
5.Set the conditionals: 
    a.If I get the correct letter:
        I.The letter replaces one of the lines (_) for "current word" slot
        II. The number of guesses remaining REMAINS THE SAME, and the letter is only added to the top part, not the bottom.
    b.If I don't guess the correct letter:
        I.The number of guesses remaining goes down by 1
        II. The guessed letter is added to the part of "letters already guesses" separated by a comma (ONLY WHEN IT'S THE SECOND LETTER)
    c.If I guess the whole word:
        I.The image on the left of the screen appears, and an effect happens. (music plays, background changes, etc..)
        II. Title on top changes with the correct answer
        III. The current word moves to the next word
        IV. The number of guesses moves back up to the original amount
        V. The letters already guessed clears up again.
        VI. Wins goes up by 1 point
    d.If I run out of guesses:
        I.Losses goes up by 1 point
        II.The Current word clears for the next word
        III.The number of guesses remaining resets
        IV. The letters already guessed clears
